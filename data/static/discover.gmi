# 🔭️ Discover Gemini content!

There are several places to go when looking for new content on Gemini.


## 📣️ Aggregators

You can think of them as lists of new posts or updated Gemini capsules. There are a few of them, and they each have a slightly different approach. For example CAPCOM picks 100 capsules at random each month and surfaces their content. Spacewalk on the other hand ranks capsules by date of last update.

## 🔖️ Directories

Unlike aggregators which detect and surface new posts automatically, directories are hand crafted and categorized lists of Gemini capsules.

## 🗞️ Zines

Zines are small magazines, usually consisting of a couple of articles, news, columns, links to interesting capsules, etc. This format is not unique to Gemini, but does benefit from Gemini's text oriented nature.

## 🎙️Podcasts

Gemini can serve not only text, but all kinds of files. There are a couple of podcasts, sometimes called gemcasts, out there. You can listen to them by downloading the specific episode audio files and opening them in your local audio player.

## 👥️ Multi-user sites

While there are many Gemini capsules that host content from individual authors, there are some with multiple users. They usually form a community of writers with shared interests or worldview. If you are looking for a way to publish content on Gemini this might be a good place to start.
